# VI
VI or VIM commands and advice for me to remember


## VI search

use / to look from top to bottom
use ? to look from bottom to top


## VI Replace
You can replace text in VI with the %s command.

{% highlight bash script %}
:%s/text/replace/g
{% endhighlight %}
This will replace text with replace as G - global whole document

{% highlight bash script %}
:%s^text/^replace/^g
{% endhighlight %}
Because here the textin question is including an / symbol you can use ^ as the split beteween actions and steps.

## VI Search and Replace Advanced
The formal syntax for searching is:

{% highlight bash script %}
:s/string
{% endhighlight %}

For example, suppose you want to search some text for the string "cherry." Type the following and press ENTER:

{% highlight bash script %}
:s/cherry
{% endhighlight %}

The first match for "cherry" in your text will then be highlighted. To see if there are additional occurrences of the same string in the text, type n, and the highlight will switch to the next match, if one exists.

The syntax for replacing one string with another string in the current line is

{% highlight bash script %}
:s/pattern/replace/
{% endhighlight %}

Here [pattern] represents the old string and [replace] represents the new string. For example, to replace each occurrence of the word [lemon] in a line with [orange,] type the following

{% highlight bash script %}
:s/lemon/orange/
{% endhighlight %}

The syntax for replacing every occurrence of a string in the entire text is similar. The only difference is the addition of a [%] in front of the [s]

{% highlight bash script %}
:%s/pattern/replace/
{% endhighlight %}

Thus repeating the previous example for the entire text instead of just for a single line would be

{% highlight bash script %}
:%s/lemon/orange/
{% endhighlight %}
