|**Analysis**                             |
|-----------------------------------------|
| - Scoping                               |
| - What are the effected systems         |
| - What packages / software is impacted  |
| - Expected Outcome                      |
| - Sol - Ist                             |
|-----------------------------------------|

|**Fixing Steps**                         |
|-----------------------------------------|
| - Perform fix that restores issue 	  |
| - Test on a Playground Environment      |
| - Do we need something else (architect)?|
|-----------------------------------------|

|**Implementation**                       |
|-----------------------------------------|
| - Change                                |
| - Create or Edit a package              |
| - Make sure to keep it generic          |
| - Create a release or snapshot          |
| - Deploy release                        |

## Programing Paradigms

|Paradigm|Description|Main traits|Related paradigm(s)|Examples|
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
|Imperative	|Programs as statements that directly change computed state (datafields)|Direct assignments, common data structures, global variables||C, C++, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby|
|Structured|A style of imperative programming with more logical program structure|Structograms, indentation, no or limited use of goto statements|Imperative|C, C++, Java, Python|
|Procedural|Derived from structured programming, based on the concept of modular programming or the procedure call|Local variables, sequence, selection, iteration, and modularization|Structured, imperative|C, C++, Lisp, PHP, Python|
|Functional|Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions avoiding state and mutable data|Lambda calculus, compositionality, formula, recursion, referential transparency, no side effects|Declarative|C++,[1] Clojure, Coffeescript,[2] Elixir, Erlang, F#, Haskell, Lisp, Python, Ruby, Scala, SequenceL, Standard ML, JavaScript
|Event-driven including time-driven|Control flow is determined mainly by events, such as mouse clicks or interrupts including timer|Main loop, event handlers, asynchronous processes|Procedural, dataflow|JavaScript, ActionScript, Visual Basic, Elm|
|Object-oriented|Treats datafields as objects manipulated through predefined methods only|Objects, methods, message passing, information hiding, data abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, serialization-marshalling|Procedural|Common Lisp, C++, C#, Eiffel, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala|
|Declarative|Defines program logic, but not detailed control flow|Fourth-generation languages, spreadsheets, report program generators||SQL, regular expressions, CSS, Prolog, OWL, SPARQL|
Automata-based programming|Treats programs as a model of a finite state machine or any other formal automata|State enumeration, control variable, state changes, isomorphism, state transition table|Imperative, event-driven|Abstract State Machine Language|
