# Some Tiny Scripts!!

## Script that logs into a list or array of servers to perform a command
This script uses sshpass to login to a server and does a command this could also have been done using Ansible if this was available for me in this case.

{% highlight bash script %}
array=(6213 4759)
echo "Array size: ${#array[\*]}"
for item in ${array[\*]}
        sshpass -p <password> ssh <user>@"$item".linux.example.nl "sudo wasctl stop ALL"
do

done
{% endhighlight %}

This example just runs a simple command but passes it through another user
{% highlight bash script %}
array=(4759)
echo "Array size: ${#array[\*]}"
for item in ${array[\*]}
do
        sshpass -p <password> ssh <user>@"$item".linux.example.nl "echo touch /tmp/#metoo | sudo su - wsp"
done
{% endhighlight %}

## passing out your public key
The next itteration should be using a public key sharing instead of a hard coded password.
{% highlight bash script %}
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh root@[your.ip.address.here] "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
{% endhighlight %}
