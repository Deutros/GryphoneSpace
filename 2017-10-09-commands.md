# Learned Bash Commands
Bash Commands that im learning.
With some Special info.
Awsome Cakes!!

## What Version am I running
cat /etc/centos-release

You may also use:
cat /etc/redhat-release

## Location
The prompt starts with some symbols and some symbols tell you where you are or where to perform commands.
{% highlight bash script %}
[root@qmlf666 ~]# This is a root user
[deutros@qmlf666 ~]$ This is a normal user
[root@qmlf666 ~]# . - The dot is this Location
[root@qmlf666 ~]# / - Slash is for the root directory
[deutros@qmlf666 ~]$ ~ Home directory of whatever user you are logged in as
{% endhighlight %}

## Wildcards or Globbin

| *                                        |
|-----------------------------------------|
| Any number of characters (or no characters at all).|
| For example, the ls ab* command would return the following filenames, assuming they exist in the current directory: ab, abc, abcd.|
|-----------------------------------------|

| ?                                        |
|------------------------------------------|

|--------------------------------------------------|

|[]                                                |
|-----------------------------------------|
| A range of options.
| For example, the ls ab[123] command would return the following filenames, assuming they exist in the current directory: ab1, ab2, ab3. Alternatively, the ls ab[X-Z] command would return the following filenames, assuming they exist in the current directory: abX, abY, abZ.|
|-----------------------------------------|

## Grep utility
The grep command uses a search term to look through a file. It returns the full line that contains the search term. For example, grep ‘Michael Jang’ /etc/passwd looks for the name of this author in the /etc/passwd file.
You can use regular expressions within a grep command. Regular expressions provide a powerful way to specify complex search patterns. Some of the characters that have a special meaning inside a regular expression. If you want a metacharacter to lose its special meaning and be taken literally, precede it by a blackslash (\\).
The grep command supports some useful switches.
To make the search case-insensitive, you can pass the -i option to the command line. The -E option enables the use of extended regular expression syntax. Another interesting switch is -v, which reverses the matching logic—that is, it tells grep to select only the lines that do not match a regular expression.

As an example, suppose you want to select only the lines from /etc/nsswitch.conf that are not blank and do not contain a comment (that is, they do not start with the # character).
This can be achieved by running the following command:
{% highlight bash script %}
  #grep -v '^$' /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep -v '^#'
{% endhighlight %}

Metacharacter and Special Characters in Regular Expressions

.
Any single character. Often used with the * multiplier to indicate any number of characters.

**[]**
Match any single character included within the square brackets.
For example the command:
{% highlight bash script %}
grep ‘jo[ah]n’ /etc/passwd
{% endhighlight %}
would return all lines in /etc/passwd that contain the string joan or john.

**?**
Match the preceding element zero or one time. For example, the command:
{% highlight bash script %}
grep -E ‘ann?a’ /etc/passwd
{% endhighlight %}
would return all lines in /etc/passwd that contain the string ana or anna.

**+**
Match the preceding element one or more times. For example, the command:
{% highlight bash script %}
grep -E ‘j[a-z]+n’ /etc/passwd
{% endhighlight %}
would return all lines in /etc/passwd that contain the letters j and n, with one or more lowercase letters in between. Therefore, this regular expression would match strings such as joan, john, and also jason and jonathan.

**\***
Match the preceding element zero or more times. For example, the command:
{% highlight bash script %}
grep ‘jo[a-z]\*n’ /etc/passwd
{% endhighlight %}
would return all lines in /etc/passwd that contain the string jo followed by zero or more lowercase letters and terminated by the character n. Therefore, the previous regular expression would match strings such as jon, joan, or john.

**^**
Match the beginning of a line. For example, the command:
{% highlight bash script %}
grep ‘^bin’ /etc/passwd
{% endhighlight %}
would return all lines in /etc/passwd that start with the sequence of characters bin.

**$**
Match the end of a line. For example, the command:
{% highlight bash script %}
grep ‘/bin/[kz]sh$’ /etc/passwd
{% endhighlight %}
would return all lines in /etc/passwd that terminate with the sequence of characters /bin/ksh or /bin/zsh (that is, all records corresponding to the users who have set Korn or Zsh as their default shells).

**grep -rl [the word you are looking]** This will search all the files in the directory

+ grep -C 6 thing [file] Grep a word or string and take 6 lines aboe and below
+ grep -A 6 thing [file] Grep a word or string and take 6 lines below
+ grep -B 6 thing [file] Grep a word or string and take 6 lines above

Note how the first grep command selects all the lines that are not blank (the regular expression that matches a blank line is ^$—that is, start of line and immediately end of line).
Then, the output is piped to a second grep command, which excludes all the lines that start with a hash character.
The same result can be obtained with a single instance of grep and the -e switch,
which allows you to specify multiple search patterns on the same command:
{% highlight bash script %}
grep -v -e '^$' -e '^#' /etc/nsswitch.conf
{% endhighlight %}
For more information on regular expressions, type man 7 regex.

**ls |grep something |grep -v RemoveStuff(filter)** you can grep and remove some parts

## Watch command
**watch -d ls -ltrh** watch directory with ls -ltrh command for changes
<br>watch -d 'ls -l' | fgrep joe' = watch the dir for changes from user joe

## Last command
To see who logged in over time and a history

## Lists and such
ls - ltrh	show directory
+ l = long list
+ t = by modified time
+ r = reverse
+ h = human readable

## Processes PS and Pkill

**pkill -f [software]**	This will search all processes for the software you mention and kill it.

**ps -e** 	show all processes
