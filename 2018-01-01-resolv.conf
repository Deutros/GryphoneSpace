To fix the resolv.conf to search certain domains.
Add:
{% highlight bash script %}
options timeout:1
options attempts:1
search linux.example.com unix.example.com example.com example.nl
nameserver 192.168.1.100
nameserver 192.168.2.100
{% endhighlight %}

Plus this explains why both commands are necessary.

Edit /etc/network/interfaces:

{% highlight bash script %}
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.3.3
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.3.1
    dns-search example.com
    dns-nameserver 192.168.3.45
    dns-nameserver 192.168.8.10
{% endhighlight %}
These changes will not take place unless you reboot or reload the configuration file:

In order to update the interfaces file live it is necessary to run the following command

{% highlight bash script %}
echo "/nameserver 192.168.3.45
nameserver 192.168.8.10
search example.com"/ | sudo resolvconf -a eth0.inet
{% endhighlight %}

This allows an update to the interface without a reboot or reloading.

However, the above command changes will be lost after a reboot if the changes in the /etc/network/interfaces are not made.

By the way the last answer from BDenis in this list actually works in place of the last command by parsing the /etc/network/interfaces file and piping those lines into the command sudo resolvconf -a eth0 It's actually half the answer and a really good example of inline sed parsing. If you want to see how it does this just run the first part of the command and watch it parse the /etc/network/interfaces file and spit out all the necessary information you need to run the sudo resolvconf -a eth0 command:

{% highlight bash script %}
sed 's/#.\*$//' /etc/network/interfaces | grep dns- | sed 's/dns-//g'
Notice this would produce the same out put as the command:
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash script %}
echo "nameserver 192.168.3.45
nameserver 192.168.8.10
search example.com"
Provided that the /etc/network/interfaces file is configured with this information:

iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.3.3
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.3.1
    dns-search example.com
    dns-nameserver 192.168.3.45
    dns-nameserver 192.168.8.10
{% endhighlight %}
