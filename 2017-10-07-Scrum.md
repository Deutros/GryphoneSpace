## Value Statement and considerations
As a <Persona>
A great technique to capture your insights about the users and customers is working with personas. Personas are fictional characters that are based on first-hand knowledge of the target group. They usually consist of a name and a picture; relevant characteristics, behaviours, and attitudes; and a goal. The goal is the benefit the persona wants to achieve, or the problem the character wants to see solved by using the product.
But there is more to it: The persona goals help you discover the right stories: Ask yourself what functionality the product should provide to meet the goals of the persona.
 
I want <Functionality>
This the description of your goal, objective or feature but must not contain too much detail or be too broad. Keep it clear and concise, avoid technical details.
 
Too broad
·         A team member can view iteration status.
Too detailed
·         A team member can view a table of stories with rank, name, size, package, owner, and status.
·         A team member can click a red button to expand the table to include detail, which lists all the tasks, with rank, name, estimate, owner, status.
Just right
·         A team member can view the iterations stories and their status with main fields.
·         A team member can view the current burndown chart on the status page, and can click it for a larger view.
·         A team member can view or hide the tasks under the stories.
·         A team member can edit a task from the iteration status page.
So that <Benefit>
The benefit, result or goal you wish to achieve.
 
## Apply the INVEST rule
User Stories are at best when they leave room for discussion. A way of verifying if your User Story is complete is by using the INVEST rule:
Independent
should not be reliant on other stories. If it does, combine the two.
Negotiable
leave room for creativity in the solution. A story is problem, not a solution.
A Story is not a contract, but should describe an ambition  
Estimable
make sure the story gives away how much time it needs to be solved, otherwise it will never happen.
Provide enough information about the context and technical issues. After reading the story everybody involved should have a clear understanding about what is needed to come up with a solution.
Small 
The story should be solved and tested within half a sprint by 1 or 3 developers (depending on the size of your team and length of your sprints 
Testable
It should be clear when the User Story is completed: Can we test that we solved the problem?
 
Add details via Testing & Acceptance Criteria, Definition of Done or Conditions of Satisfaction
Acceptance criteria and Conditions of Satisfaction
Conditions of Satisfaction are the expectations of what the PO or story requestor is expecting and consideres the story to be succesfull.
Acceptence criteria are the testable requirements and states how the PO or requestor knows the Condition of Satisfaction are met.
 As a rule of thumb,it seems best to have three to five acceptance criteria for detailed stories.
 
## The definition of done
A teams definition of done is an agreed-upon set of things that must be true before any product backlog item is considered complete.
 
 
## Common Mistakes
1. User story for 'A User'
It is best to be specific about the role of the user and whenever possible refer to the persona a user has.
NB: User Stories for Product Owners should also be avoided, Unless the Product Owner is indeed a User for which certain functionlaity is being implemented. E.G. A dashboard for data anlysis. But even in those cases it should be clear what Value is being generated for the End Customer.

Which brings us to the next common mistake:

2. No Business Value or Customer benefit
Example:
As a SD Client I want I want to filter my search results
We have the role, we have the need, but reason and business value are missing. Why does a Service Desk Client want to have filtering option? What does he/she want to achieve?
NB: Busines Value can also be attributed to the parent Epic, but the customer benefit should be clear from the Story description.
3. No Acceptance Criteria or Conditions of Satisfaction
If we dont know how we can establish when a User Story has been resolved it is very likely the wrong development tasks are defined and wrong estimates are made. Defining acceptance criteria helps understanding what kind of solution needs to be delivered and how the result could be tested.
Use examples and simple drawings to remove assumptions.
